   <p>
    At the end of Part 1, 120 tokens were allocated between you and your coparticipant based
    on the result of the tasks you carried out. The winner in Part 1 got 90 tokens and the
    loser in Part 1 got 30 tokens. In the next page, you will give a proposal to take some tokens
    from your coparticipant. The maximum values you can take, depends on the tokens your
    coparticipant have. If your coparticipant has 90 tokens you can take from 0 to 90 tokens,
    but if your coparticipant has 30 tokens, you can take from 0 to 30 tokens. At the end of this
    part, there are two proposals. One of the proposals is your proposal, and another is your
    coparticipant’s proposal. One these two proposals will be randomly assigned at the end of
    experiment for payments. You will not be aware of your final tokens you win in this task
    until the end of experiment which is after task 4.
</p>
<p>
    In the next page, your task is to choose how many tokens you want to take from your
    coparticipant. For any amounts you will choose to take from your coparticipant,
    your coparticipant’s payoff will decrease the same amounts, but your payoffs will
    increase only half of them. For example, if you choose 20 tokens to take, your coparticipant’s
    payoffs deacrease 20 tokens, but your payoffs will increase 20/2=10 tokens. For any amount you select in a
    slider, you can see 3 numbers: The tokens you take, your payoffs after this take and your
    coparticipant's payoffs after this take.
