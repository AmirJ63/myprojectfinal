   The overall session will be split into five tasks. Task 5 will be a survey which you will be
    asked to complete prior to payment.  After you have completed all five tasks, you will be paid
    based on the decisions you made in the session, and then will be free to leave.

</p>

  <p>
  You will first get the instructions for task 1, and then, once you have completed task 1, you will
      get the instructions for task 2, and then the instructions for task 3, and so on.  In the
      session today, you will be paid based on your decisions in two of the five tasks.
      Task 1 is a simple rating task that will not be paid.  Decisions made in task 2 will be paid
      for all individuals in the session.  For decisions made in Task 3 and 4, only one of them will
      be randomly selected for payment.

  </p>
<p>
At the end of the session, the computer will randomly select either task 3 or task 4.
    If task 3 is the task that is selected for payment, then your earnings will be based on your
    decisions in task 3 (in addition to decisions in task 2).  If task 4 is selected for payment,
    then your earnings will be based on your decisions in task 4 (in addition to decisions in task 2).

</p>
    <p>

        Since no one knows which task is the one that you will be paid for, your best strategy
        is to treat each task as if it is the one that will be paid.
