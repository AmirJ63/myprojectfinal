<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p >
    Welcome to today’s experiment and thanks for coming. This is an experiment in decision-making. At the end of the experiment, you will be paid the earnings you obtained from this experiment plus a participation fee of £3.
It is important that you remain silent and do not look at other people’s work. If you have any questions, or need assistance of any kind, please raise your hand and an experimenter will come to you. If you talk, laugh, exclaim out loud, etc., you will be asked to leave and you will not be paid. We expect and appreciate your cooperation.
</p>

  <p>I will now describe the nature of the tasks within the experiment. </p>
<p>
    Once the experiment is started; you can see 5 pairs of paintings. In each pair, the painter of one painting is Klee and that of another in Kandinsky. They are not in or-der. In each pair, you should give scores to two paintings based your preferences by filling the blank square below the pictures. Your total scores to both painting should be 5 scores. For example, if you like the first painting so much and you do not like the second option at all, you can give 5 scores to first one and 0 scores to the second. Or if you prefer the second one a little bit more than first one, you can give 3 scores to second one and 2 scores for the first one.
 After all participants fill their choices, we rank you and other participants based on your choices. Half of participants who prefer Klee’s paintings is named ‘Klee group’ and another half who prefer Kandinsky’ paintings is named ‘Kandinsky group’.
