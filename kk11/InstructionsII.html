<p>
    In the session today you will participate in five tasks.   You will be paid a £ 3 participation
    fee, plus additional money based on your decisions in the session.  Please read and pay attention
    to all instructions.  If you do, you will be able to earn a considerable amount of money.

</p>


  <p>
  We will be using a currency called "tokens" in this session.  All decisions and earnings
      during the session will be expressed in terms of tokens.  At the end of the ses-sion,
      tokens will be exchanged for pounds at the rate of 0.1 tokens per pound.  This means that
      for every 100 tokens you earn in the session, you will be paid £ 10.

  </p>
<p>
Your computer number is your ID number, which you will use to collect your earnings at the end of
    the session.  Your decisions will be recorded privately at your computer terminal.
    Other participants will never be informed about your earnings from the experiment.
    The experimenter will not be aware of your actual decisions either, but only your final
    payment.  You will be paid individually, privately, and in cash at the end of the session.
</p>
    <p>
Please read all instructions carefully. You will be asked to take a quiz to demonstrate understanding
        before being allowed to continue, so please read all instructions.  You will earn a
        considerable amount of money if you do.
</p>

    <p>
Please click the "continue" button to continue the instructions.
