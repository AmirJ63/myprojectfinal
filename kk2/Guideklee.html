</p>
<p>
“Paul Klee, a Swiss-born painter, printmaker, and draughtsman of German nationality, was originally
    associated with the German Expressionist group Der Blaue Reiter, and subsequently taught at
    the Bauhaus, the widely influential German art school of the interwar period. Klee's diverse
    body of work cannot, however, be categorized ac-cording to any single artistic movement, or
    "school." His paintings, which are at times fantastic, childlike, or otherwise witty. Klee
    challenged traditional boundaries separating writing and visual art by exploring a new expressive,
    and largely abstract or poetic language of pictorial symbols and signs. Arrows, letters,
    musical notation, ancient hieroglyphs, or a few black lines standing in for a person or object
    frequently appear in his work, while rarely demanding a specific reading.”
