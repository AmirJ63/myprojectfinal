    <P>
Based on your decisions in task 1, you have been assigned to the{{participant.group}} group.
        In this task, you will interact with other participants in the {{ participant.group}} group.
        Your task is to determine which painting of a set of paintings, was painted by
        {{participant.group}}.
    </P>
<p>
    In order to help you and your group members with this task, you will first be given some
    information about {{ participant.group}}â€™s paintings, so that the group can learn more about his
    painting style.  After this, you will be shown 5 paintings, and the task will ask the group to
    select which one of the five was painted by {{ participant.group}}.  Your group will do this twice,
    with each correct answer earning each group member 5 tokens.

</p>
    <p>
        Note that you will participate in this task as a group.  What this means is that when
        the paintings are up on the screen, you and your group members will be able to chat
        with one another to discuss the answer.  Each time you will be allowed to chat for 3
        minutes before being asked to provide an answer.  Please keep all discussion in the
        chat about the paintings, and refrain from providing any identifying information or
        using foul language.

    </p>
Please click the "continue" button to learn more about {{ participant.group}}.
