   The following paintings were painted by Wassily Kandinsky.
    Please read the explanation about Kandinskyâ€™s painting style:
</p>
<p>
"Wassily Kandinsky exploited the evocative interrelation between colour and form
    to create an aesthetic experience that engaged the sight, sound, and emotions of the public.
    Highly inspired to create art that communicated a universal sense of spirituality,
    he innovated a pictorial language that only loosely related to the outside world but expressed
    volumes about the artist's inner experience. His visual vocabulary developed through three
    phases, shifting from his early, representational canvases and their divine symbolism to his
    rapturous and operatic compositions, to his late, geo-metric and biomorphic flat planes of colour."
