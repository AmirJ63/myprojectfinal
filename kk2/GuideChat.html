   Thank you for reading about {{ participant.group}}.  On the next page you will see 5 paintings, and your
    group will be asked to select the painting that was painted by {{ participant.group}}.  Note that
    only one of the five paintings was actually painted by {{ participant.group}}, so there is only one
    correct answer.  Also note that the group is only allowed to select one painting as the selection
    for the entire group.  Here is how this will work:
</p>
<p>
One group member will be randomly selected as the spokesperson for the group.  This is the
    person who will have to submit the response on behalf of the group.  Therefore, the group
    needs to reach a consensus about which painting they most think was painted by {{ participant.group }}.
</p>
<p>
On the next page, you will view the paintings and will be allowed to discuss amongst your group
    for a total of 3 minutes. The discussions will take place using online chat. Please note
    that you may discuss as much as you prefer, as long as you follow the following rules:
    <p>
    1. Please do not identify yourself or send any information that could be used to identify
    you (e.g., age, race, professional background, etc.).
</p>

<p>
2. Please refrain from using any obscene or offensive language.
</p>
<p>
Remember that only one person will be selected to be the spokesperson for the group.
    Hence, please be sure to communicate with the spokesperson.
    If your group selects correctly, you will earn an additional 5 tokens each.
    You will participate in this task twice, so you can earn an additional 10 tokens in total
    from the task.
